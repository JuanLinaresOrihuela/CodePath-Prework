Personal Idea - Cycling Time App:
- Currently working on developing an app that aims to simplify the process of determining whether it's a suitable day for cycling or not. This app considers specific parameters such as weather conditions, rain probability, and wind speed. By analyzing these factors, users will no longer need to spend time researching information from various weather apps. With our app, they can quickly assess if it's a favorable day for cycling, allowing them to make informed decisions and save valuable time.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

· Learning all the required tools to build an Xcode app.
· Learning Github and Git while working on the project.
· Make an interesting README page where people can understand the project.
